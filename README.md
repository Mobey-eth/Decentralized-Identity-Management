# Soulbound Token (SBT in Solidity)

### A Soulbound Token (SBT) Implementation for Decentralized Identity Management

Blog post and video about SBT's here: https://jamesbachini.com/souldbound-token/

Following on from Vitalik's co-authored whitepaper at:

Soulbound tokens have been proposed as a metholocating non-transferable data to an ethereum address.

Where as an ERC20 or NFT token can be transferred between users SBT's are static and cannot be moved between accounts.

This opens up a wide range of applications because it lets developers map data to their users in much the same way we rely on user databases today.

There is no current ERC standard for SBT

It allows the contract to associate an address with a structured data set. It also allows 3rd parties to use the contract to create profile data sets with the same structure. Users have the ability to delete their data.
